# Examples for Albert
This repository contains examples for my good friend Albert.

## Example info
- [Example 1](https://github.com/DrakeData/examples_for_albert/blob/main/example1/eample1_file_systems.ipynb): provides examples on how to work with directories and file paths. It also talks about config files and how to access them if they are not in the working directory.
